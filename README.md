# seleneInventoryBundle
Add Inventory Functions to your project

## What Is This Thing?
This just brings products and inventory to your bundles.  While this does keep track of prices, this does not have a checkout option or a payment option.  This will build invoices data for your own invoicing system.
This will not have a system to build out out an admin panel like the Selene CMS Bundle, but will include CRUD controllers for the EasyAdminBundle.  I want other admin systems to be represented here, but that will be good for someone else to work on.

## Can I Help?
Yes.
